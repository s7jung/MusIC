# SE 101 Project: MusIC

This project aims to convert an image of sheet music into an audio format (WAV) which can be played directly.

It currently can convert a MusicXML file to a MIDI or WAV file, and can be used with Cal Pratt's [SheetVision](https://github.com/cal-pratt/SheetVision) to obtain a MIDI file from an image.
